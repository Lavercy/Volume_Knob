# Volume Knob
I followed [this guide](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/3d-print-an-oversized-media-control-volume-knob-arduino-basics_30184/) by Mikolas Zuza. 
One changes I made was that I wanted the knob to do horizontal scroll which isn't a method included in the library in the guide. So I found a forked library that has the fuctionality of horizontal scroll. 
The libraries used in this project are all included here.
